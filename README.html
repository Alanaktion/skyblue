<h1>SkyBlue</h1>

<p>Minimal CSS (SASS) framework I made for my own needs.</p>

<p>Uses grid system with 12 columns. Add <code>col</code> class and responsive ``xs-# sm-# md-# lg-#"</p>

<p>This is not Bootstrap killer, I just think Bootstrap is way too bloated. This is minimal framework that I use to start my projects and then expand it.</p>

<p>I included <a href="http://themes-pixeden.com/font-demos/7-stroke/index.html">great stroke icons</a> by Pixeden.</p>
