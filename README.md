SkyBlue
=======

Minimal CSS (SASS) framework I made for my own needs.

Uses grid system with 12 columns. Add ``col`` class and responsive ``xs-# sm-# md-# lg-#"

[Cheeck the demo](http://stanko.github.io/skyblue/).

This is not Bootstrap killer, I just think Bootstrap is way too bloated. This is minimal framework that I use to start my projects and then expand it.
